# Java gRPC API - Simple-news

**Exercise goal:** The purpose of this exc. is to give an overall understanding of a backend application. You’ll be implementing a simplified version of a news provider API. The concepts that you’re going to apply are:

- RESTful API development;
- gRPC architecture and Java gRPC server implementation;
- Web application: authentication, permissions and security;
- Data modeling in SQL, database migrations and application refactoring;
- Serialization, deserialization and immutable interfaces with Jackson.
- Stubbing/mocking, DRY principle, fluent API and unit/integration tests with JUnit 5 + Mockito.
- Target level: This is an all around exc. slightly more suited for junior devs. Can be applied to a more senior audience with changes in the discussion sections.

Final accomplishment: By the end of this exc. you’ll have the backbone of a production-ready, gRPC-backed web API.
